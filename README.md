# cv
My data-driven cv powered by Pagedown, a markdown setup.

I've followed [nstrayer's hints](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) and tweaked the style (that is, `css`). It embraces academic minimalism, especially with regard to the publications. There are also some custom edits in the `cv.rmd` file that improve its accessability. I find this version much more suitable to a more traditional work environment, as opposed to the tech-savvy world of the original design.
