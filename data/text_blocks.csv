intro,"I study the material politics of energy transitions and sustainability measures. My background is in sociology, and I published widely on relational approaches like actor-network theory, on economic sociology, digital methods, and interdisciplinary discussions in waste, energy and valuation studies. <br> <br> My research is shaped by an ethnographic lens. I draw on qualitative research methods, while quantitative digital methods enrich the qualitative perspective.",

publication_1,"The publication presents international research on waste and brings together contributions on science and technology studies, value and waste. This article is part of a special issue co-edited with an Austrian colleague who is well versed in Marxism. The article outlines a new approach to global economies of waste, and we use our article to reflect on competing theoretical approaches – which also points at our very own two perspectives. Building on the anthropologist Anna Tsing and her ecology research, we argue for a focus on frictions in order to highlight globalisation processes and their inherent inequalities. In doing so, we are particularly concerned to highlight the important impulses of social movements, without which the materiality of waste would not have come into the focus of academic discussions as much as it has. With our contribution, we also reflect the intensive process of producing the special issue, in which a rich diversity of positions have their say.","Info:Three selected publications with a summary (max. 1,000 characters) of their impact on your research profile"
