Open access.","The article is the result of a collaboration with my waste research colleague Schlitz from Austria, and part of a special issue that dissects global inequalities through waste. It grapples with the fact that waste is inherent to the permanently polluted world in which we are living, while its effects are shared unequally. With this article, we make an innovative proposal for the waste discussion and the literature on political economy. Building on the anthropologist Anna Tsing, we argue for focusing on frictions that make globality possible. We also point to the important role of social movements, without which the scholarly study of materiality would not exist in the form it currently circulates. With facing frictions, we lastly illustrate a productive way of working and thinking that brings together heterogeneous and sometimes competing approaches, which applies to us authors as well, where STS meets Marxism.",,,2019,,,,,

Valuation Studies 7(2): 221‐255. Open access.","With this article, I have made a central theoretical and empirical contribution to the value and waste-specific research discourse. The article is part of a special issue that uses assemblage theory to argue for a materialist methodology. It is published in a decentralised, open-access journal that is anchored in Science and Technology Studies and Organisation Studies. I try to spread my research across formats that are as open as possible, and this journal is a prime example of this. The basis for the paper is my empirical research in a recycling firm, highlighting practices of deformation that make economic calculations possible. The study thus demonstrates the value of qualitative research.",,,2020,,,,,

Degrowth, multi‐species conviviality and the micro‐politics of cultured meat. Anthropological Theory 21 (3): 386-408. Open access.","This is the result of exploratory research that was originally intended for a DFG Collaborative Research Centre. The text discusses lab-grown, so-called cultured or 'clean' meat. This is meat substitute produced by means of biotechnology. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for example, estimates that lab-grown meat has sufficient potential to help mitigate the enormous greenhouse gases caused by meat production. In the animal ethics debate, cultured meat is sometimes discussed in a positive light. We turn our attention to degrowth research and argue that the field can benefit from a rigorous analysis of technology in action. The paper helped me identify material politics as a research focus. In the period between the dissertation and my first post-doctoral phase, I contributed empirical work and literature syntheses to this endeavour; later, the research led me to guide a monograph on human-animal relations.
